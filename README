Using autossh and reverse ssh tunneling to enable accessing your machines even if they are NAT'd or behind firewalls - automatically.

How to use this:

(Note this script assumes you are using Ubuntu)

wget http://github.com/mikeymckay/reverse_ssh_tunnel/raw/master/setup_reverse_tunnel.sh
chmod +x ./setup_reverse_tunnel.sh
sudo ./setup_reverse_tunnel.sh

Why to use this:

You Want to forward a port from some device somewhere, whether it's behind a firewall or not, to make it accesable on a given computer all the time.

I have just added the ability to select which port can be forwarded etc.
